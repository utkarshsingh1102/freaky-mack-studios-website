# Freaky Mack Studios: placeholder checklist

Every piece of missing content on the site, where it shows, what it's for, and who needs to supply it.
Fill in the **Answer** column (or send the files) and hand it back. I'll wire everything in.

**Who supplies what**
- **YOU**: something you decide or set up: accounts, keys, domain, tool choices.
- **CLIENT**: content only Freaky Mack (Izaan Khan) can give: names, photos, films, quotes, legal details.
- **BOTH**: you decide the format and the client gives the content.

Placeholders are written exactly as they appear on the site (e.g. `[Project title]`), so you can search for them.
Paths are relative to the repo root.

> **Heads-up:** the homepage has its own copies of the projects, people, podcast episodes, client list and social links. When the content comes in, I'll point the homepage at the same data as the inner pages so every value only has to be entered once.

## 1. Fill once, used everywhere

| # | Value | Shows on | Where in code | Purpose | Supplied by | Answer |

| 1.2 | `[CITY]` / `[City]` | Same places as 1.1 | The same 7 places (Start a project: `:80`, shown as "[City], India") | Studio's city | CLIENT | |
| 1.3 | `[CITY]` (court city) | Terms §09 "Governing law" | `src/content/legal/terms.tsx:31` | City whose courts handle disputes. It may differ from 1.2, so ask the lawyer. | CLIENT (with lawyer) | |
| 1.4 | `[LEGAL ENTITY NAME]` | Privacy §01, Terms §01 | `privacy.tsx:25`, `terms.tsx:23` | Registered business name (e.g. "Freaky Mack Studios LLP" or the proprietor's name) | CLIENT | |

| 1.6 | Company start year, and "six years" | Studio chapter 1, Hero, meta description, Studio page ×3, founder bio | `src/content/studio.ts:3`, `src/app/_components/Hero.tsx:76`, `src/app/layout.tsx:16`, `src/app/(site)/studio/page.tsx:13,56,92`, `src/app/(site)/people/page.tsx:86` | Confirms "six years of advertising" is still accurate; the start year goes in Chapter 1 | CLIENT | |
| 1.7 | YouTube channel URL | Footer (all pages), homepage "Watch on YouTube ↗", Originals "Subscribe on YouTube ↗" | `src/shared/config.ts:32`, plus hard-coded copies in `src/app/_components/Podcast.tsx:27` and `src/app/_components/Footer.tsx:36` | Link to the podcast and films channel | CLIENT | |

| 1.9 | `Last updated [DATE]` | Privacy, Terms | `src/components/site/LegalPage.tsx:39` | Date the legal text was finalised, filled in after the lawyer's review | YOU | |

**Leads to confirm with the client (not verified):** an older draft in `Documentation/freaky-mack-studios-home.html` mentions "Andheri West, Mumbai". The client questionnaire `Documentation/FreakyMack_Website_Client_Questionnaire_Short.pages` may already answer some items here.

## 2. Home `/`

### Showreel
| # | Placeholder | Where | Purpose | Supplied by | Answer |

### Chapter 01: Selected work (6 rows)
**Done:** the homepage now shows the first six films from `src/content/projects.ts`: Mercedes-Benz Global Star, Changa, PC Jeweller TVC, India Fashion Awards, Albela and McDonald's Chicken McWings. To change which films appear, reorder the list in that file.

- **2.6 `[ STILL — {title} ]`** (`src/app/_components/WorkPreview.tsx`): the preview image that changes on hover. The first project still is reused here. **Supplied by:** CLIENT (covered by section 5).

### Chapter 03: Testimonials (×2)
Source: `src/app/_components/Testimonials.tsx`

| # | Placeholder | Where | Purpose | Supplied by | Answer |

### Chapter 04: Podcast (3 cards)
Source: `src/app/_components/Podcast.tsx`. These should be the 3 newest episodes from `/originals` (section 6).

| # | Placeholder | Where | Purpose | Supplied by | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.11 | `[ EPISODE ART ]` ×3 | `:47` | 16:9 episode thumbnails (the YouTube thumbnail is fine) | CLIENT | |

| 4.3 | ~~`[NN] in total`~~ | `WorkGrid.tsx` | **Done:** counts the films in the data (41) | — | 41 |

---

## 5. Project pages `/work/[slug]` (41 films)

**Done:** the 41 films from the content library (`FILE_STRUCTURE.md`) are now the projects in `src/content/projects.ts`, in the order shown on `/work`. Each has its format, runtime and frame shape, plus the client, director and cast wherever the file name states them. "Film 01 of 41" and "Next up" work automatically.

**Still owed for every project (CLIENT):**

| Field | Placeholder | Where it shows | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| logline | `[One-line logline — what the film is, in a sentence.]` | Under the title, search/social description | One sentence |
| year | `[Year]` (except the three below that have one) | Hero meta, /work card | Release year |
| who | `[Client]` (where the file name doesn't say) | Under the title, /work card | Client, brand or artist |
| brief | `[Two or three lines on what the client needed and who it was for.]` | "The brief" | 2–3 lines |
| idea | `[How we cracked it — the concept, the look, the one decision that made the film.]` | "The idea" | 2–3 lines |
| on screen | `[Where it ran and what happened — only real results, shared with the client's permission.]` | "On screen" | Where it ran and real results, approved by the client |
| credits | `[Name]` for Agency, Producer, Director of photography, Editor, Colour, Sound (and Client/Director where unknown) | Credits list | A blank role can be hidden |
| stills | `[ STILL 01 — WIDE ]`, `[ STILL 02 ]`, `[ STILL 03 ]` | "Frames from the film", /work card, homepage preview | 3 stills, 16:9, at least 2400px wide (you'll send these later) |
| video | `[ FILM — YOUTUBE / VIMEO EMBED ]` | Player | Filled when the films are uploaded (see 11.5) |

**Per film.** Anything in `[brackets]` still needs an answer. Check every title: they come from file names.

**Please confirm (CLIENT):**
- **Titles to check:** Rudraprayag (file `Renew_Rudraprayag`: is the client "Renew"?), Soanbhadra (file `DA_Soanbhadra`: what does "DA" stand for, and is the spelling "Sonbhadra"?), Sexual Harassment (the file name misspells it; is there a proper campaign title?), Film for Ace, Jaldi Bidai, PKCC, Sex Sorted, S&S — Trailer, TLP — Teaser.
- **Untitled films:** the two vertical cuts `VIDEO-2026-02-26-21-26-33` (`ad-film-vertical-01` / `-02`) need titles and a client. Are they separate projects, or two cuts of one?
- **Clients:** India Fashion Awards, TOIFA Aftermovie, Albela, Kashi, The Midnight Hour, Happy Republic Day, Nayi Soch Wali Azadi and the Govt. ads. Which are Freaky Mack's own films (these would feed the Originals slate)?
- **Low-resolution masters:** Fabindia ×2 (406p), Voting Campaign (480p), Sexual Harassment (362p) and the two vertical cuts (480p). Higher-resolution files would look much better on the site.
- **Vertical films (9:16):** Falaknama, Harshita Gaur, NoughtOne Show and the two vertical cuts. I'll give these a vertical player when the videos go in.

## 11. Setup and accounts (YOU)

| # | Item | Where | Purpose | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11.1 | **Domain** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (Vercel env), `src/shared/config.ts:8` | The live address. It feeds the sitemap, robots.txt, social previews and Terms. Buy it and point it at Vercel. | |
| 11.2 | **Enquiry form endpoint** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` (Vercel env), used in `src/shared/enquiry.ts:54` | Without it, "Send it over" opens the visitor's email app instead of sending. Create a Formspree form that delivers to freakymackstudios@gmail.com. | |
| 11.3 | **Hide the theme picker at launch** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PITCH_MODE=off` (Vercel env) | The Light/Dark/accent picker is for pitching only. Also tell me the final theme and accent (currently Dark + Grey). | |
| 11.4 | **Vercel plan** | Vercel dashboard | Hobby (free) is for non-commercial use, so move to Pro before the client launch. | |
| 11.5 | **Cloudflare Stream** | Cloudflare dashboard, then `REEL` in `config.ts` and the project videos | Buy the **Starter Bundle ($5/month)**, upload the films, then send me your `customer-xxxx` code and each video's ID. Allow only your domain and `*.vercel.app` to play them. | Customer code: <br> Video IDs: |
| 11.6 | **Business email** | `src/shared/config.ts:13` | Keep freakymackstudios@gmail.com, or switch to e.g. hello@yourdomain? (CLIENT decides) | |
| 11.7 | **Analytics** | See 10.3 | Pick one, or none. This decides the cookie wording in 10.6. | |

Contact details already filled in and real: freakymackstudios@gmail.com, +91 97115 42274, and WhatsApp on the same number. **CLIENT:** confirm these are final.

## 13. What I'll do once answers arrive (no action needed from you)

- Point the homepage's copies (work list, people, podcast, clients, footer links) at the shared data, so each value lives in one place.
- Add image and video fields to the projects, stills, episodes, crew and slate data, and replace the grey placeholder blocks with the real media, loading lazily.
- Build the Cloudflare Stream player, with a poster shown until someone clicks play.
- Generate the favicon from the logo mark.
- Build a cookie banner if option (b) is chosen in 10.6.
- Remove the legal draft brackets once the lawyer has signed off, and set the "Last updated" date.
